## Deployment Security Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing

```bash
# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level high
pip check
safety check

# Run SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
bandit -r src/
semgrep --config=auto src/

# Container security scan
docker scan magentic-ui:latest
```

### 2. Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with security-first approach
terraform plan -var-file="security.tfvars"
terraform apply

# Verify security group rules
az network nsg rule list --resource-group magentic-ui-prod --nsg-name app-nsg

# Check Key Vault configuration
az keyvault show --name magentic-ui-kv --resource-group magentic-ui-prod
```

### 3. Application Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with security configurations
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Verify security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com
curl -I https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Test authentication flow
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# SSL/TLS configuration check
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 your-domain.com
testssl.sh your-domain.com

# Security headers verification
curl -I https://your-domain.com | grep -E "(Strict-Transport|X-Content|X-Frame|X-XSS)"

# Rate limiting test
for i in {1..150}; do curl https://your-domain.com/api/health; done
```
