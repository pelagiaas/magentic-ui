# Deployment Options Comparison

This document compares the different deployment options available for Magentic-UI.

## 📋 Deployment Methods

| Method | Best For | Difficulty | Cost | Scalability | Management |
|--------|----------|------------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Local Development** | Development, Testing | ⭐ Easy | Free | ❌ None | Manual |
| **Docker Compose** | Self-hosting, On-premise | ⭐⭐ Medium | Hardware only | ⭐ Limited | Manual |
| **Azure Developer CLI** | Cloud deployment, Production | ⭐⭐ Medium | ~$43-75/month | ⭐⭐ Good | Automated |
| **Terraform** | Enterprise, Multi-cloud | ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | ~$43-75/month | ⭐⭐ Good | Manual |

> **Note**: Azure Developer CLI now uses Terraform backend for infrastructure management, providing enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code while maintaining developer-friendly deployment experience.

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From Local to Azure (azd)
```bash
# 1. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# 2. Deploy to Azure
./azd-deploy.sh deploy
```

### From Terraform to azd
```bash
# 1. Backup existing Terraform state
cd terraform
terraform show > terraform-backup.txt

# 2. Destroy Terraform resources
terraform destroy

# 3. Switch to azd
cd ..
./azd-deploy.sh deploy
```

### From Docker Compose to Azure (azd)
```bash
# 1. Export your environment variables
docker-compose config > docker-backup.yml

# 2. Configure azd environment
cp .env.example .env
# Copy values from docker-backup.yml to .env

# 3. Deploy to Azure
./azd-deploy.sh deploy
```

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Development
- **Local installation** with `pip install magentic-ui`
- Use Docker Compose for testing containers

### For Production
- **Azure Developer CLI (azd)** - Recommended for most users
- Uses Terraform for enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code
- Developer-friendly deployment experience
- Built-in monitoring and CI/CD
- Estimated cost: ~$43-75/month

### For Enterprise
- **Pure Terraform** if you need:
  - Multi-cloud deployment
  - Complex networking requirements
  - Existing Terraform infrastructure
  - Advanced customization
- Same infrastructure cost as azd (~$43-75/month)
- More manual setup and management required
